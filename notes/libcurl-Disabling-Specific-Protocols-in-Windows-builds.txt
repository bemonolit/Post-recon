Disabling Specific Protocols in Windows builds

The configure utility, unfortunately, is not available for the Windows environment, 
therefore, you cannot use the various disable-protocol options of the configure utility on this platform.

However, you can use the following defines to disable specific protocols:

    HTTP_ONLY disables all protocols except HTTP
    CURL_DISABLE_FTP disables FTP
    CURL_DISABLE_LDAP disables LDAP
    CURL_DISABLE_TELNET disables TELNET
    CURL_DISABLE_DICT disables DICT
    CURL_DISABLE_FILE disables FILE
    CURL_DISABLE_TFTP disables TFTP
    CURL_DISABLE_HTTP disables HTTP
    CURL_DISABLE_IMAP disables IMAP
    CURL_DISABLE_POP3 disables POP3
    CURL_DISABLE_SMTP disables SMTP

If you want to set any of these defines you have the following options:

    Modify lib/config-win32.h
    Modify lib/curl_setup.h
    Modify winbuild/Makefile.vc
    Modify the "Preprocessor Definitions" in the libcurl project

Note: The pre-processor settings can be found using the Visual Studio IDE under 
"Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> General" in VC6 and "Project -> Properties -> 
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor" in later versions.
